### Post Css <br/>
1. PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript. It allows you to use JavaScript plugins to transform your CSS, which can be more powerful and flexible than traditional preprocessor languages like Sass or Less. <br/>
2. PostCSS works by parsing your CSS into an abstract syntax tree (AST), applying transformations to the tree using plugins, and then generating new CSS from the modified tree.<br/>
3. PostCSS plugins can do a wide range of things, from adding vendor prefixes to your CSS, to transforming your code with advanced features like custom selectors or variables. <br/>
4. Plugins can be installed and configured individually, allowing you to create a customized PostCSS workflow that meets your specific needs.<br/>

### Some popular PostCSS plugins include:<br/><br/>

Autoprefixer: adds vendor prefixes to your CSS, based on the latest browser vendor data<br/>
CSS Modules: allows you to write modular, scoped CSS by generating unique class names for each module<br/>
PostCSS Preset Env: allows you to use future CSS syntax today, by transforming new CSS features into their equivalent CSS that works in current browsers<br/>
CSSnano: minifies and optimizes your CSS for production use<br/>
To use PostCSS, you typically install it as a development dependency in your project, along with any plugins you want to use. You can then configure PostCSS in your build process to transform your CSS as needed. <br/>
PostCSS can be used with a variety of build tools, including Webpack, Gulp, and Rollup.<br/>

The config file looks like
```
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    './public/index.html'
  ],
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#FF0000',
        secondary: '#00FF00',
        tertiary: '#0000FF',
      }
    },
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif']
    }
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      backgroundColor: ['active'],
      textColor: ['active'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
